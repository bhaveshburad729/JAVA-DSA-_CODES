/*
 * ðŸŽ¯ Problem
 * 
 * We need to place N Queens on an N x N chessboard such that:
 * 
 * No two Queens attack each other.
 * 
 * Queens attack vertically, and diagonally (left + right).
 * 
 * We must print all valid boards and also count total solutions.
 * 
 * ðŸ”‘ Logic of the Code
 * 
 * Board Setup
 * 
 * The chessboard is represented by a 2D array board[n][n].
 * 
 * Each cell is initialized with 'x' (empty).
 * 
 * Recursive Backtracking (nQueens)
 * 
 * The algorithm works row by row.
 * 
 * For the current row, try placing a Queen ('Q') in every column.
 * 
 * Before placing, call isSafe(row, col) to check if the position is safe.
 * 
 * If safe â†’ place Queen and recursively call nQueens for the next row.
 * 
 * If we reach row == n, it means all Queens are placed â†’ print the board and
 * increase count.
 * 
 * After recursion, backtrack by removing the Queen ('x') to explore other
 * possibilities.
 * 
 * Safety Check (isSafe)
 * For a given cell (row, col), check only above rows because below rows are
 * still empty:
 * 
 * Vertical check: No Queen in same column above.
 * 
 * Left diagonal check: No Queen on upper-left diagonal.
 * 
 * Right diagonal check: No Queen on upper-right diagonal.
 * 
 * If all checks pass â†’ position is safe.
 * 
 * Counting Solutions
 * 
 * Each time a valid arrangement is found, increment count.
 * 
 * At the end, print Total solutions = count.
 * 
 * Output
 * 
 * Prints every valid chessboard arrangement.
 * 
 * Shows total number of ways Queens can be placed.
 * 
 * âš¡ Example (N=4)
 * 
 * One valid arrangement looks like:
 * 
 * Q x x x
 * x x Q x
 * x Q x x
 * x x x Q
 * 
 * 
 * For N=4, there are 2 total solutions.
 * For N=8, there are 92 total solutions.

ðŸ”‘ Logic of the Code

Chessboard Initialization

The board is represented by a 2D array char board[][].

Initially, all cells are filled with 'x' (empty).

Recursive Function (nQueens)

The algorithm works row by row.

At each row, try placing a Queen ('Q') in each column one by one.

For every position (row, col), check if itâ€™s safe using isSafe().

If safe â†’ place Queen and move to next row (row+1).

If not safe â†’ skip that column and try next.

When we reach the last row (row == n), it means all Queens are placed successfully â†’ print the board.

Safety Check (isSafe)
For any position (row, col):

Vertical Check: Look upwards in the same column. If a Queen exists, not safe.

Left Diagonal Check: Look upward-left diagonal. If a Queen exists, not safe.

Right Diagonal Check: Look upward-right diagonal. If a Queen exists, not safe.

If all checks pass â†’ safe to place a Queen.

Backtracking

If a Queen is placed and further recursion fails to find a solution, remove that Queen ('x') and try another column.

This ensures we explore all possible valid placements.

Printing the Solution

Whenever a valid arrangement of N Queens is found, print the board.

âš¡ Example (N=4)

For a 4x4 board:

Place Queen in row 0 â†’ multiple options.

Check each option recursively for row 1.

If no valid position found in a later row â†’ backtrack to previous row, remove Queen, and try a new position.

Continue until all 4 Queens are placed safely.

One valid solution looks like:

Q x x x
x x Q x
x Q x x
x x x Q  */
